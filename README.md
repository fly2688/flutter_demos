# flutter_demos

Recently, I began to learn [Flutter](https://flutter.io/). Every time when I learned something new, I used it to build a demo and wrote the relevant knowledge to [my blog](https://blog.whezh.com/).

## How to use

Clone the repository.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hezhii/flutter_demos.git
```

Check that a device is running.

```bash
$ flutter devices
```

Run the app. You can run on the specified device via `-d` optionï¼Œif you need.

```bash
$ cd flutter_demos
$ flutter run
```
